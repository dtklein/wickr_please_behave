#TODO
* Put technical or procedural mechanism to remove the need to run this as root (using SUDO for rights escalation)
* Look into trimming down the additional packages installed to satisfy dependencies; are some optional or redundant?
* Find how the key is stored and make sure I am setting up the environment to persist it between runs of the container
* Add a script to create and install a launcher and icon in the Applications menu (like the Start menu in Windows)
* Document the what, how and why
* Solicit feedback and peer review from people who actually know from Docker, since I certainly don't
